# Bullet-Hell-PyGame

Just a quick 1 day project to learn pygame. 
its a sudo bullethell/spaceinvader crossover
enemies spawn and fly at a randsom speed, dodge or destroy them

there a 1/4 chance of ammo spawning after destroying an enemy
each ammo box holds anywhere from 1-20 rounds. 

todo list: add a game over and start game splash screens
add pause/resume functionality
add more diverse enemies who can shoot back.
